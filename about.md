This is a user interface redesign of the [CMS Data Element Library](https://del.cms.gov/DELWeb/pubHome).  It intends to address some of the issues with the current DEL site, including:
* The [DEL homepage](https://del.cms.gov/DELWeb/pubHome) mentions pages for FAQ, Help, and a User Guide but does not link to them anywhere on the site
* It takes multiple clicks to get to any useful information on the site, including code set downloads and aggregated information reports
* The [Download HIT Codes](https://del.cms.gov/DELWeb/pubDownloadHitCodesForm) output omits the following fields:
  * Section Name
  * Question Text
  * Skip Pattern Trigger
  * Lookback Period (days)
  * Status
  * Status Date
  * Item Use
  * Collection Time Period/Item Subset(s)
  * Parent Item ID
  * Copyright Information
* The [Download HIT Codes](https://del.cms.gov/DELWeb/pubDownloadHitCodesForm) page omits the following items:
  * The entire Hospice Item Set (HIS) (versions 1.00.0 and 2.00.0)
  * IRF-PAI versions 1.10, 1.2, 1.3
  * LCDS versions 1.01, 2.01
  * MDS3.0 versions 1.00.2, 1.00.6, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 1.3
  * OASIS versions C1-102015, C1-012015, C-082009
* There is no aggregate information about the assessment items (e.g., total data elements per assessment item, list of linked health IT standards used in each assessment item, etc.)
* There are no links from this page to the authoritative sites for each of the assessment items (e.g., link IRF-PAI to https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/InpatientRehabFacPPS/IRFPAI.html)
* There is no visualization of commonalities/discrepancies between the various data sets
* From the [Search](https://del.cms.gov/DELWeb/pubNavSearch) and [Report](https://del.cms.gov/DELWeb/pubNavRpts) pages, there is no link back to the [DEL homepage](https://del.cms.gov/DELWeb/pubHome)
